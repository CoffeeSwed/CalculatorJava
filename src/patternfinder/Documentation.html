<h2>Factories</h2>
<h3>What they do</h3>
<p>The factories will go through a patternstring and do appropriate actions based on the factory.
For example, WordFactory will create patterns of the word pattern.</p>
<h3>When they are called/used?</h3>
<p>The factories are called atleast once, and the order of the factories
called depends on the order of which they are added to the lists <b>PatternFinder.factories</b> and <b>PatternFinder.extensions</b>.
The factories in the list <b>PatternFinder.factories</b> are called first. 
If the Factory return an instance of <b>patternfinder.pattern.factories.Result</b> with the "tag" <b>didEditPattern true</b>, all the factories will be iterated again, stopping the current iteration.

<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Note that <b>specialWordFinder</b> is a "standard" factory, called just before the factories of the list <b>PatternFinder.extensions</b>!
