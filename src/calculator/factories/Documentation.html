<h1>Calculator.Factories</h1>
<h2>What the classes do</h2>
<p>The classes in this package are factories which are goes through a patternString
 and performs appropriate mathematical actions!</p>
 <p>For example, the AdditionFactory will look for a pattern of
 Decimal Symbol Decimal and if the Symbol value equals to "+",
 it will perform addition on the two decimals and replace the first
 Decimal pattern with the Result and remove the other two.</p>
 <h2>Which factory is executed first?</h2>
<p>The patterns are added to patternFinder in the class calculator.Calculator
and the order of the factories added decides on which factory will be called first.
Note that specialWordFinder is used to make sure function names and etc
are their own words, for example "esin" would be divided into
Symbol "e" and the word "sin"</p>
<h2>The special StorageFactory</h2>
<p>The storage factory classes located in factories.storagefactory
are special and can store variables, for example, if one enters
storeas(129.0,"e"), and then enters load("e"), the load("e") part of a patternString
will be replaced with 129.0
<h2>Special patterns</h2>
Special patterns created by the calculator are in the calculator.patterns package.
