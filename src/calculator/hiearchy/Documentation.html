<h2>What it does</h2>
The class ContainersHierachy will take a container and create
a list of order where the most "inner" container, for example, in the case of sin(cos(2))
, the container next to the function name cos
 will be first element of the generated list.
 The lists are used to make sure that the most inner "container"
 is solved first in PatternFinder
